          Hover Here to see the Features
        </P>
        Object Oriented: In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is
        based on the Object model. Java inherits the Oops features like abstraction, encapsulation,
        inheritance, and polymorphism.
      </li>
      <li class="li">
        Platform independent: Unlike many other programming languages including C and
        C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather
        into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and
        interpreted by virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run.
      </li>
      <li class="li">
        Simple: Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP
        we can easily become master in java.
      </li>
      <li class="li">
        Secure: With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free systems.
        It allows all the Java programs to run inside the sandbox only and prevents many
        activities from untrusted resources including reading or writing to the local disk,
        creating any new process or even loading any new dynamic library while calling a
        native method.
        Java never uses any kind of pointers. Java has its internal mechanism for memory
        management.
        Byte code is another thing that makes Java more secure
      </li>
      <li class="li">
        Architectural-neutral: Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format
        which makes the compiled code to be executable on many processors, with the presence
        of Java runtime system.
      </li>

      <li class="li">
        Portable: Java is portable because of being no implementation dependent aspects of the
        specification. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C which makes it portable.
      </li>
      <li class="li">
        Robust: Java is robust because of strong exception handling techniques and strong memory
        management. Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by focussing on
        compile time error checking as well as runtime checking. Also Java has automatic
        garbage collection process which frees the memory by deleting no longer used objects.
      </li>
      <li class="li">
        Multithreaded: With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that
        can do many tasks simultaneously. This allows minimizing the workload of single thread
        and to minimize the execution time.
      </li>
      <li class="li">
        Interpreted: Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and is
        not stored anywhere.
      </li>
      <li class="li">

        High Performance: With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.
        Because JIT executes the byte code only on requirement basis.
      </li>
      <li class="li">
        Distributed: Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet where we
        can implement client server applications, also invoke remote methods.
      </li>
      <li class="li">
        Dynamic: Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is designed to
        adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs can carry extensive amount of run-time
        information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time.
      </li>
